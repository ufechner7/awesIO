# AWESIO
Input/Output standard for airborne wind energy systems


This branch reuses the windIO code with modifcations

Only two schemas have been made to this date: power_curves and wind_resource. These two schemas and file types are being used by a thesis student working on an Airborne Wind Energy Performance Assessment (AWESPA) toolchain.
